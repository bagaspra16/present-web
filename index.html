					<h3>First Date!!!</h3>
					<p>June 28 2023, the day we had our first date, honestly I didn't know what to do when I met you at that time, but you were really so stunning that I forgot who I was. I've never been that close to any woman until that day, maybe that's why you think I'm wierdo, but what's even wierd is that I've never felt that comfortable with someone I've met for the first time, and I really enjoy that feeling.</p>

					<h3>Our special day<3</h3>
					<p>August 12 2023, is the beginning of all the results of our faith and trust in each other that made us who we are today. On that day I was very afraid that all my behavior was not enough to convince you, I understand but at least I tried, and thank you very much for opening your heart to me, I love you, love you more, love you forever.</p>

					<h3>Erebos or soteria?</h3>
					<p>November 14 2023, is a pretty hard day for myself, I'm really sorry for myself, but I feel like I deserved it, I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm just tired. When I came home from your house after our fight, I'm quite doubtful about the continuity of this relationship in that way, even to this day, I still imagine what would have happened if I hadn't told you about that day.</p>

					<h3>Waterfall to you<3</h3>
					<p>December 24 2023, Bogor is the furthest we have ever traveled together. The trip taught us many lessons, I began to realize that my emotions were never stable in normal terms, but the waterfall and atmosphere there were really worth fighting for. I realized that at that moment your smile, your tears, your anger were the most sincere things you gave me, I began to learn to appreciate them, and continue to understand them.</p>

					<h3>Jakarta With You</h3>
					<p>April 28 2024, days have passed, months have passed, years have changed, but the feelings have never changed. Egoism is still there, grumpy is still there, but his love always exceeds everything. I'm still here, and I hope you are too, because I'm sure all this is just a prelude to a story book that will be very long.</p>
